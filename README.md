# CS380_FinalProject
In this project, we will be using JavaFX to create a GUI that allows users to book flights on an airline.

This project was a group effort by Braeden Olney, Shelby Jorgensen, and Alex Chikerenda for our CS380 Software Engineering class at Central Washington University. Through this proeject, we learned how to use JavaFX to create applications, and with a connection to MySQL store, retrieve and manipulate data in a database with our application. 

This project was designed to simulate a flight booking system, where a user is able to see all available flights, book a flight, and with the help of an admin, cancel flights when needed.
